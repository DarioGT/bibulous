Example 1
=========

The following example is taken from a question posted at ``http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/147675/bibtex-scientific-style-with-pages-at-the-end``. The OP asks:

    Where can I find bibtex style, which looks approximately like this? Somehow all styles (even ``science.bst``), which I find use ``format.vol.num.pages`` function, which put pages right after volume number. But the order I used to see and use is ``volNum-year-pages``. I can simply move the line ``format.date "year" output.check`` into ``format.vol.num.pages``, but 1. I am not sure whether this is correct (looks strange for me), 2. I don't know how to add the ``---`` sign in front.

With Bibulous, we can easily provide templates that provide the formatting that the OP asks for:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example1.bst

so that if we use this template together with the following database file:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example1.bib

then we get the formatted result shown below

Example 2
=========

The next example is taken from the bibliography style found in: Dimitri Mihalas and James Binney, _Galactic Astronomy: Structure and Kinematics_, 2nd ed. (W. H. Freeman, New York, 1981). A snapshot from the the book's bibliography looks like

.. image:: _static/example2a.png
   :width: 50%

To produce this style, we can define the following templates:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example2.bst

so that with the following database file:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/example2.bib

we get the following formatted result

.. image:: _static/example2b.png
   :width: 50%
