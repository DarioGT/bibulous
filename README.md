bibulous
========

Bibulous - a simple drop-in replacement for BibTeX.

Bibulous developed out of frustrations with developing bibliography styles using BibTeX's obscure style file language, and from the realization that bibliographies are highly structured, so that they can be specified simply and flexibly using a template approach.

At the same time, an attempt has been made to incorporate a lot of the modern enhancements to BibTeX, such as the ability to work with languages other than English, allowing use of non-standard bibliography entry types, functionality for enhanced citation styles, etc.
