Bibulous
========

Bibulous is a simple drop-in replacement for BibTeX using style templates.

Bibulous developed out of frustration with developing bibliography styles using BibTeX's obscure style file language, and from the realization that bibliographies are highly structured, so that they can be specified simply and flexibly using a template approach. With templates, one can develop entirely new bibliography styles in a matter of minutes, and often without having to refer to the user manual during the entire process.

At the same time, an attempt has been made to incorporate a lot of the modern enhancements to BibTeX, such as the ability to work with languages other than English, allowing use of non-standard bibliography entry types, functionality for enhanced citation styles, and increased options for author name formatting, among others.

Bibulous' "style template" files allow a user to visualize the entire bibliography format structure in a concise way within a single page of text. Moreover, the template is structured with its own mini-language, intended to allow uses to create flexible formatting instructions quickly and easily.

Example
-------

For a very simple bibliography, consisting of only journal articles and books, your style template file might only consist of just two lines::

Bibulous is a brand new project, and so it has been a solo effort. Anyone interested in helping out is welcome to join; just send me an email at the developers mailing list.
